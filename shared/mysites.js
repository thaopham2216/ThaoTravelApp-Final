        description: "Simply setting foot in Japan's cosmopolitan capital is an experience within itself. A city known for its bustling streets and flashing neon signs, Tokyo has an electric energy and plenty of attractions to discover.

Shopaholics will find plenty of must-have designer products in Ginza. And for history buffs, Tokyo offers centuries-old temples and shrines to explore."

        description: "Kyoto is Japan in a nutshell. It\’s the cultural and historical heart of the country. It\’s the best place in all Japan to experience traditional temples, shrines, gardens, geisha, shops, restaurants and festivals. In short, Kyoto is the most rewarding destination in all of Japan and it should be at the top of any Japan travel itinerary. Indeed, I may be biased, but I\’d go so far as to say that Kyoto is the most rewarding single city in all of Asia."

Words such as surreal, fast-paced and hyper-reality quickly come to mind when describing Las Vegas. Words such as subtle and quiet are not often associated with this city."

        description: "With dramatic peaks and pristine lakes, Yellowstone National Park is an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolored pools swirl around hot springs; verdant forests weave past expansive meadows; and volatile geysers launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much unspoiled natural beauty, it's no wonder why everyone suspected John Colter (a scout for explorers Lewis and Clark) was embellishing when he first described Yellowstone's geothermal curiosities in 1807. Nowadays, there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary. While you traverse its 3,000-plus square miles of mountains, canyons, geysers and waterfalls, be prepared to share the trails with permanent residents like buffalo, elk and sometimes even grizzlies.

        description: "Snow-capped peaks and azure lakes are just two reasons why Glacier National Park is one of America's most striking parks. There are more than 700 miles of hiking trails in this Montana park, plus 13 designated areas for camping. In winter, travelers can enjoy snowshoeing and skiing, while summer is when vacationers can go swimming and whitewater rafting, among other popular activities. For those who'd rather admire their surroundings from their car, a scenic drive along Going-to-the-Sun Road can't be missed."
